To execute the code, make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

The dependencies are as follows:
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn


Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the code by executing the following command:

python final_code.py

This code will use the preprocesed dataset - pre_processed_data.csv. It will create plots and save them as png images for all visualizations used in the presentations

final_codes_notebook.ipynb is the jupyter notebook version of the code. It contains all the visualizations used in the presentation.
