   Web Dashboard

   Written by Kyle Wade (https://github.com/kyle1373)

   Description:
   This web page displays 16 questions for the user to answer. When the user clicks submit, a POST request is sent to the Python server located at "/python_server/app.py". The server runs a model to predict if a child's screen time is beneficial or harmful and whether parenting has become easier or harder compared to 20 years ago.

   Usage:
   Access this page by navigating to https://localhost:3000 after running "yarn dev".

   Dependencies:
   - Next.js (React framework)
   - Styled-components (for styling)
   - "mappings.json" (a JSON file containing question-answer mappings)
   - "Inter" font from Google Fonts

   Components:
   - Home: The main React component responsible for rendering the survey questions and handling user responses.

   State and Variables:
   - answers: Stores user responses to survey questions.
   - predictions: Stores the predictions made by the Python server.
   - apiResultsMappings: Maps numeric prediction values to descriptive strings.
   - question_keys_map: Maps question keys to their descriptions.
   - question_keys: Array of question keys used to iterate through questions.
   - inter: Font style for text elements.

   Functions:
   - handleRadioChange: Updates the "answers" state when a radio button is selected.
   - handleSubmit: Sends user responses to the server and updates the "predictions" state with the server's response.

   Structure:
   - The main component renders a list of survey questions with radio button options.
   - When the user submits their answers, the data is sent to the server for analysis.
   - The server's predictions are displayed along with images.
