## Introduction
Recently, more children are being exposed to the internet at a younger age, with a majority of parents being unsure about what effects it may have on their child. This study addresses likely correlations with why children are getting online at a younger age and its effects on parenting.

## Our Dataset
We took a [Pew Research study](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/07/28/parenting-children-in-the-age-of-screens/) in which 5,513 parents of children under 18 were surveyed with various questions about...  
* Demographic and socioeconomic background.
* Perspective of social media. 
* Their child’s screen activity.
* Their perspective on their child’s screen activity.
* Much more.  

This data is in the `data` folder in this repository.

## Data Preprocessing
After download the Pew Research study, we preprocessed the data. Originally, the file we got from the survey had columns and values which did not easily refer to the original survey. Through our preprocessing, we converted the data from labels and numbers into mapped responses given by the parents. More information can be found in the `preprocessing` folder, with its own documentation.

## Visualizations
We created various visualizations in order to pose interesting questions and make insightful conclusions, including parent perspective on technology, child age with types of social media apps they use, parental demographics and their strictness on child social media use, and much more. More information can be found in the `visualizations` folder, with its own documentation.
