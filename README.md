Recently, more children are being exposed to the internet at a younger age, with a majority of parents being unsure about what effects it may have on their child. This study addresses likely correlations with why children are getting online at a younger age and its effects on parenting.

## Our Dataset
We took a (Pew Research Study)[https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/07/28/parenting-children-in-the-age-of-screens/] in which 5,513 parents of children under 18 were surveyed with various questions about...  
* Demographic and socioeconomic background.
* Perspective of social media. 
* Their child’s screen activity.
* Their perspective on their child’s screen activity.
* Much more.
