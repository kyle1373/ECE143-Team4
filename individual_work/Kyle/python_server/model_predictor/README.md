## Assumption and Summary of Analysis
* Objective: To predict the "How_is_curret_days_parenting" column using other columns in the dataset, addressing the challenge of class imbalance.

Steps Taken:

Initial Dataset Analysis:

* The dataset contained multiple columns, mostly numerical, representing various features.
* The target variable, "How_is_curret_days_parenting," was identified based on its position among other columns.

### Data Preprocessing:
* Handled missing values by imputation.
* Applied one-hot encoding to transform categorical columns based on provided mappings.
* Initial Model Training with Logistic Regression:

* Trained a logistic regression model on the preprocessed data.
* Encountered class imbalance issues, as indicated by poor model performance on minority classes.

### Addressing Class Imbalance:
* Created a balanced dataset using undersampling and oversampling techniques.
The first attempt with undersampling resulted in a very small dataset, leading to an overfit model.
* The second attempt with oversampling (SMOTE) couldn't be executed due to environmental constraints.
* Finally, balanced the dataset by downsampling the majority class and oversampling the minority classes to equal sizes.
* Model Training with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting:

* Trained both Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers on the balanced dataset.
Evaluated models on a validation set, achieving perfect accuracy.

### Assumptions and Considerations:
* The class imbalance was a significant issue, addressed through resampling strategies.
* The final balanced dataset may still not fully capture the complexity of real-world data.
* Perfect accuracy on the validation set suggests a possibility of overfitting. This needs further investigation with an independent test set.
* The choice of models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) was based on their robustness and ability to handle complex datasets.
